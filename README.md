# DesignPatternCalculator
_A calculator with multiple versions - each featuring a different set of design patterns._

### Array:
 - simple array class that is more useful than the default C array but less useful than the C++ vector
 - Featured Design Patterns: **None**
 
### Cooler Array:
 - a better conglomerate of array objects + Stack, Queue that both uses the array.
 - Featured Design Patterns: **Template**
 
### Calculator:
 - a simple calculator using the typical Stack related algorithms but with commands
 - Featured Design Patterns: **Command, Composite, Factory, Abstract Factory**
 
### Complicated Calculator:
 - a calculator using a more complicated underlying node and tree structure
 - Featured Design Patterns: **Visitor, Builder**
 
### Unnecessarily Complicated Calculator:
 - same as above except with custom auto pointer and iterator classes
 - Featured Design Patterns: **Proxy, Iterator**

---

### Tools Used:
 - **Atom + GIT** (made coding process much easier, especially with Atom's built-in GIT abilities)
 - **MPC** (to make compiling C++ files easier)
 - **Valgrind** (to help with fixing complicated errors)
 - **Laptop** (enabled me to poof Germanic symbols onto a shiny screen resulting in magic)
 - **Hipster Coffee Mug** (essential for poofing mentioned above)
